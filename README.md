# Covid_Modeling
Applying an SIR model to model Covid data

The fitting plots we obtain can be seen directly in SIR_fit.png. To reproduce the fits locally, download the repository and execute main.py. A discussion of the results can be found in the docstring of the main file, which is also printed when executing it.
